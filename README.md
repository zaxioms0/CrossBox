A printer for the NYT mini crossword

Thanks for visiting! [People on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/crossword/comments/1oy7tg7/i_made_a_box_to_print_the_nyt_mini/) seemed to think this was cool, so I'm putting it on Github if anyone
else wants to make it. This currently *does* work without an NYT Games subscription. Hopefully it stays that way :] 

The original version of this project was done on an esp8266 and information about it can be found in the `esp8266` directory.
I am currently working on a version using the esp32.
